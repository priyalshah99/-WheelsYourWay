                The invention of the motor car can be termed as a quantum leap at the peak of the European Industrial Revolution.
                However, since the days of Karl Benz, little has been done to disrupt the way cars are bought.
                We at WHEELS YOUR WAY are on a mission to transform the way vehicles are purchased and rented.
                The concept of vehicle rentals is yet to spread its wings in India.
                As pioneers in the Indian self drive vehicle rental industry, we believe in the mantra-
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"> “Why buy a vehicle, when you can rent one?”</span>
      </p>   
            
            <p><span id="title"> WHY WE DO IT? </span> <br>
            Transport is the backbone of any modern economy. 
           However, rapid motorisation effectuates its own set of issues.
            While on one hand the burgeoning number of cars on the road has become a menace in metros across India,
            a number of cities suffer from lack of good urban commuting solutions.
            The concept of car rentals may be simple, but it holds immense potential.
             Be it the positive impact of rental vehicles on the environment or reducing the number of vehicles out on the streets,
              the shared economy of self drive vehicle rentals is a promising solution to a number of problems plaguing urban India.</p>
            
              <p><span id="title">HOW WE DO IT?</span> <br>
            Even the most complex of problems has a simple yet elegant solution.
             At Wheels Your Way we don’t just rent vehicles, we create products which complete the existing ecosystem.
              We build technology which provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of urban commute by connecting commuters to vendors in the self drive vehicle rental business.
               Our vision is to provide a platform where vehicle owners can engage customers and conduct business seamlessly. </p>
